I'm a rising second-year student at Florida State University studying Computer Science. Throughout my years of high school, I have always been exposed to fields in STEM—particularly in engineering. Now that I'm in college, I've narrowed down my interests to lean more towards computer programming and I'm currently exploring different career paths within tech.
